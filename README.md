## Abstract

The problem of constructing confidence intervals (CIs) for the difference between coefficients of variation of two zero-inflated gamma distributions is considered. As gamma distribution does not have closed-form maximum likelihood estimators, the parameters of gamma distribution have to be estimated numerically. To this end, we propose four different generalized confidence intervals (GCIs) based on fiducial inference, Box-Cox transformation, parametric bootstrap, and the method of variance of estimates recovery (MOVER). Performances of the four GCIs are evaluated and compared via extensive simulation. Simulation results show that all four methods return satisfactory results according to coverage probabilities, even for the setting of small sample sizes.
